    "Prof. Smith has a bit of a conundrum. She is playing a 5th-level Halfling Paladin in her Dungeons and Dragons campaign and has the opportunity to craft her own armor using a combination of iron and leather. Prof. Smith's Halfling has a budget of 150 gold pieces. The Halfling character isn't very strong and can carry a maximimum of 80kg. Each square meter of material has an associated protection rating. Optimization nerd that she is, Prof. Smith would like to build her armor with the available material to maximize the total protection rating. Iron and leather vary in protection rating, cost, and weight:\n",

    "(a)  Formulate a linear program to help Prof. Smith figure out how many $m^2$ (square meters) of each type of material she should purchase to maximize her total armor protection rating. State the math model, then code and solve the model using Julia.\n",
    "\n",
    "(b)  Code the same model once again, this time separating the parameters from the solution as we did in class (see Top Brass examples).  Confirm that you obtain the same solution as in part (a).  \n",
    "\n",
    "(c)  Solve  the  problem  graphically  by  plotting  the  feasible  set  and  contour  lines  for  the  objective function.  Confirm that you obtain the same solution as in the previous parts.\n"
